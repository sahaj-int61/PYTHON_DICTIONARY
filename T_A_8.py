"""
Dictionaries can have nested data too. Also, you can add a new key to a
dictionary as they are mutable (changeable). Try to add the key "work"
to dict with values shown below.

Since dictionaries are mutable, they have some methods that tuples
don't have.
.clear() is one of them and it clears the whole dictionary.
